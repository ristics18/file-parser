(1) Write MySQL query to find IPs that mode more than a certain number of requests for a given time period.

SELECT IP FROM log WHERE DateTime BETWEEN ? AND ? GROUP BY IP HAVING COUNT(IP) > ?

Example: SELECT IP FROM log WHERE DateTime BETWEEN "2017-01-01.13:00:00" AND "2017-01-01.14:00:00" GROUP BY IP HAVING COUNT(IP) > 100



(2) Write MySQL query to find requests made by a given IP.

SELECT Request FROM log WHERE IP = ?

Example: SELECT Request FROM log WHERE IP = "192.168.228.188"

*If we do not want duplicates:

SELECT DISTINCT Request FROM log WHERE IP = "192.168.228.188"

*If we want all the information:

SELECT * FROM log WHERE IP = "192.168.228.188"


* Just to clarify
